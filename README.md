# mapbox-gl-js-toggle-raster-basemap-example

## Description

Example of how you could use raster layers in mapbox-gl-js to toggle basemaps by setting the style to be empty then adding individual layers for each basemap and editing visibility of each layer. This does not reload all additional layers the way that setting a new style does.

### Note:

This only works with raster tile layers as implemented and not vector basemaps.

## To use:

Placeholder for a [mapbox token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/access-token/), and set it in the beginning of the ts file if you want to do any mapbox things, but this simple example doesn't need it.
